 Student Wellbeing & Academic Performance Analytics

A complete end-to-end data science and BI project using Excel, Power BI, Python (Jupyter), and Streamlit. This project analyzes how sleep, study habits, and lifestyle affect students’ mood, stress, and academic scores—and provides predictive models and an interactive app.

## Features

- Data cleaning and exploration in Excel
- Interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Regression and classification models in Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Live predictions via Streamlit web app

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw data (Excel file)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook(s) with all code and analysis
- `models/`: Trained ML model files (for Streamlit)
- `powerbi/`: Power BI dashboard (PDF)
- `app/`: Streamlit app for live predictions
- `requirements.txt`: All dependencies for Python/Streamlit app

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-wellbeing-analytics.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app/app.py


4. (Optional) Open the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/` to explore the analysis.

## Key Insights

- Stress is the strongest driver of low mood.
- Study hours and sleep are most important for academic performance.
- The app provides real-time mood, score, and stress risk predictions.
